buildings. The CFD analyses can be conducted either by low-fidelity simulations (RANS) or by high-fidelity ones (LES). The low-fidelity model can efficiently estimate wind pressures over a large range of wind directions, but it generally lacks accuracy. On the other hand, the high-fidelity model generally exhibits satisfactory accuracy, yet, the high computational cost can limit the number of approaching wind angles that can be considered. In order to take advantage of the main benefits of these two CFD approaches, a multi-fidelity machine learning framework is investigated that aims to ensure the simulation accuracy while maintaining the computational efficiency.\n","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"73a5748a36cea377c7979903f4958bae","permalink":"https://OnkaraJadhav.github.io/project/data4wind/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/data4wind/","section":"project","summary":"Multi-fidelity ML framework that takes RANS variables as inputs and predicts LES flow fields.","tags":["Machine Learning","Multi-fidelity","Model Order Reduction","Numerical Mathematics","Computational Fluid Dynamics","RANS and LES"],"title":"Machine learning and deep learning for CFD","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"It is essential to be aware of the financial risk associated with an invested product. The risk analysis of financial instruments often requires the valuation of such instruments under a wide range of future market scenarios. The market scenarios (e.g., interest rates) are then input parameters in a valuation function that delivers the fair value of such financial instruments. These models are calibrated based on market scenarios that generate a high-dimensional parameter space. In short, to perform the risk analysis, the financial model needs to be solved for such a high dimensional parameter space, and this requires efficient algorithms. These two benchmark cases present the model order reduction approach based on the proper orthogonal decomposition approach with greedy sampling approaches for parameter sampling. The first case generates the 10000 simulated yield curves, which are then used to calibrate the financial model parameters. The second case presents both the classical and adaptive greedy sampling approaches.\nIn the source directory, one can find all source files required to run the benchmark cases. The directory benchmark contains the input data with the executable files. The Benchmark1_1.m file executes the yield curve simulation while the Benchmark1_2.nb file runs the parameter calibration. The classical greedy and adaptive greedy sampling techniques can be executed using Benchmark2_1.m and Benchmark2_2.m files. One can find a PDf file with a detailed step-by-step description of the benchmark case in the directory documentation.\n","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"a9f521fa564aa18088c7d39e3ed3068c","permalink":"https://OnkaraJadhav.github.io/project/morfinance/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/morfinance/","section":"project","summary":"Benchmark cases for yield curve simulation, classical and adaptive greedy sampling approaches developed in https://doi.org/10.1186/s13362-021-00105-8.","tags":["Model Order Reduction","Computational Finance","Numerical Mathematics","Machine Learning","Stochastic analysis","Optimization"],"title":"Model Order Reduction for Finance","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"f026f1b3a31c5ae35444db68aca68aa2","permalink":"https://OnkaraJadhav.github.io/project/wim2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/wim2019/","section":"project","summary":"Talk presented in the WIM2019 workshop.","tags":["Model Order Reduction","Machine Learning","Computational Finance","Numerical Mathematics"],"title":"Workshop in Industrial Mathematics 2019","type":"project"},{"authors":["Onkar Jadhav"],"categories":null,"content":"Overview Model Order Reduction in Computational Finance: https://www.romsoc.eu/model-hierarchy-for-the-reduced-order-modelling/\n","date":1595376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595376000,"objectID":"fd624f846ec25b9c4eeba07c85a149e4","permalink":"https://OnkaraJadhav.github.io/post/getting-started-copy/","publishdate":"2020-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started-copy/","section":"post","summary":"Curse of Dimensionality","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Model order reduction for Financial risk analysis, blog post","type":"post"},{"authors":["Onkar Jadhav","Andreas Binder","Volker Mehrmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582761600,"objectID":"5fd10dc79c54a29baff435bfed339f26","permalink":"https://OnkaraJadhav.github.io/publication/preprint2/","publishdate":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint2/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the error analysis of the model order reduction (MOR) framework developed in https://doi.org/10.1186/s13362-021-00105-8","tags":[],"title":"Error Analysis of a Model Order Reduction Framework for Financial Risk Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Onkar Jadhav","Andreas Binder","Volker Mehrmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582761600,"objectID":"72aecfa97fc361dd02cc9180cebb5a0c","permalink":"https://OnkaraJadhav.github.io/publication/preprint/","publishdate":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a model order reduction (MOR) approach for high dimensional problems in the analysis of financial risk.","tags":[],"title":"Model order reduction for parametric high dimensional models in the analysis of financial risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x -
